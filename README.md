SOM - Simple Object Machine
===========================

SOM is a minimal Smalltalk dialect used to teach VM construction at the [Hasso
Plattner Institute][SOM]. It was originally built at the University of Ã…rhus
(Denmark) where it was also used for teaching.

Currently, implementations exist for Java (SOM), C (CSOM), C++ (SOM++), and
Squeak/Pharo Smalltalk (AweSOM).

A simple SOM Hello World looks like:

```Smalltalk
Hello = (
  run = (
    'Hello World!' println.
  )
)
```

This repository contains the standard library of SOM, without an actual SOM
implementation. Please see the [main project page][SOM] for links to the
VM implementation.

With CSOM, the given example could be executed for instance like:
   `./CSOM -cp Smalltalk Hello.som`

AweSOM can be asked to directly evaluate a given string, for instance like:
   `SOMUniverse new eval: '''Hello World!'' println'.'.`
